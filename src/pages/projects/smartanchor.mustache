SMARTANCHOR


This device provides the skipper with one more tool that allows him or her to stay more relaxed if spending the night at anchor. I've done several tests with a device attached on an anchor and linked to the boat via a cable. The first figure shows an example of a measurement. I first devised a system that allows to correctly process the data and trigger an alarm in case of a detection of some vibrations. It computes the RMS value of acceleration over the three axes, then a derivative is computed to detect sudden changes of gravity. This is followed by a low pass filtering and a Schmitt trigger. I'm currently working on the communication between the device and the boat and ultrasonic waves seem like to only option. I built a fully software DBPSK modulator running on the device attached to the anchor. The demodulation is again fully software and uses a Costas loop to reconstruct the carrier frequency (non coherent demodulation). So far it has only been implemented in MATLAB, but using real data that has been transmitted over ultrasonic waves from one side of the room to the other. The last figure shows the demodulation process.
